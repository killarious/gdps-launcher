# KillaGDPS Android Launcher

Launches a vanilla copy of KillaGDPS with the Geode loader and Killarious essential mods added.

# Why?

Because there's no way to make some of our modifications on Android we need to use Geode SDK. Some of the issues are:
1. All compiled .so libraries must match length of modified strings with original ones.
2. It's very difficult and inconvient to decompile, modify and recompile cocos2d library without getting side effects.
3. Geode SDK is easier for developers to use and it's cross-platform, game modifications aren't difficult anymore.
4. We wanna give our players a bit more of freedom and features.

# How to use?

The launcher is not that hard to use.
1. Install latest KillaGDPS game release from https://github.com/killarious/KillaGDPS-android/releases.
2. Install latest KillaGDPS launcher release in Releases tab.
3. Open the launcher.
4. Click Launch button.
